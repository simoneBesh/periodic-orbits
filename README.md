# periodic-orbits
This code demonstrates periodic orbits in simple nonlinear equations, in order to help visualize dense periodic orbits in chaos theory. 

One of the properties of a chaotic system is dense periodic orbits. 
But if you don't have a background in complex nonlinear systems, this might be difficult to understand.
This is a visualization of periodic orbits in a simple nonlinear and chaotic system.
